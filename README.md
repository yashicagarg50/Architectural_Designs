### Overview:

The "Architectural Designs" project is a web application developed to provide customers with architectural floor designs. Utilizing a stack consisting of React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database, this project aims to offer a user-friendly interface for clients to explore various floor plans, request customization, and access additional services.

### Features:

1. **Floor Designs Display:** Present an array of pre-designed floor plans for users to browse through, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and images.

2. **Customization Options:** Provide users with the ability to customize existing floor plans according to their specific requirements. This includes options to adjust dimensions, layout configurations, and architectural elements.

3. **Service Offerings:** Offer additional services beyond basic floor plans, such as interior design consultations, landscaping suggestions, and structural engineering recommendations.

4. **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication and authorization features to secure sensitive information and provide personalized experiences for registered users.

5. **Interactive Interface:** Develop an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using React components and libraries to enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

6. **Feedback Mechanism:** Integrate a feedback mechanism allowing users to provide comments, suggestions, and ratings for the provided floor designs and services.

7. **Admin Panel:** Create an admin panel for managing floor plans, user requests, and service offerings. Admins should have the ability to add, edit, or remove content as necessary.
